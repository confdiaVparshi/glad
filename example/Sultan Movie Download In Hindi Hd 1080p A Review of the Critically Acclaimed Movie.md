Sultan is a biographical sports drama film directed by Ali Abbas Zafar and produced by Aditya Chopra under the banner of Yash Raj Films. The film follows the life of Sultan Ali Khan (Salman Khan), a fictional character based on the real-life wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat. Sultan is a local wrestler from Haryana who falls in love with Aarfa Hussain (Anushka Sharma), a state-level wrestler and the daughter of a renowned coach. However, their relationship faces many challenges due to their different ambitions and egos.
  
Sultan decides to pursue professional wrestling to impress Aarfa and win her hand in marriage. He becomes a successful wrestler and represents India in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, where he wins a gold medal. However, he also becomes arrogant and neglects his family and his health. He loses his son due to a blood transfusion complication and his wife leaves him. Devastated by his losses, Sultan quits wrestling and becomes a recluse.
  
Years later, he is approached by Aakash Oberoi (Amit Sadh), a businessman who wants to revive his failing mixed martial arts league called Pro Take Down (PTD). Aakash offers Sultan a chance to return to the ring and fight against some of the best MMA fighters in the world. Sultan agrees to join PTD, hoping to redeem himself and win back Aarfa's love. He undergoes rigorous training under Fateh Singh (Randeep Hooda), a former MMA champion and Aarfa's new coach. He also reconciles with Aarfa, who has given birth to their daughter.
  
Sultan faces many challenges and hardships in his comeback journey, but he also learns valuable lessons about humility, courage, and love. He eventually reaches the final match of PTD, where he faces Randy Orton (Tyron Woodley), an undefeated American fighter. Sultan defeats Randy in a thrilling fight and becomes the PTD champion. He dedicates his victory to his son and his wife. He also decides to donate his prize money to open a blood bank in his son's name. The film ends with Sultan and Aarfa living happily with their daughter.
  
The film also features Anant Sharma as Govind, Sultan's friend and assistant; Kumud Mishra as Barkat Hussain, Aarfa's father and Sultan's mentor; Parikshit Sahni as Gyan Singh Oberoi, Aakash's father and PTD's founder; Sumeet Samnani as Tiny Kukreja, Sultan's sponsor; Shibani Dandekar as Zoya Hussain, a sports reporter; Suzi Khan as Amna Ali Khan, Sultan and Aarfa's daughter; Marko Zaror as Marcus, an MMA fighter; Marrese Crump as Tyron, an MMA fighter; Ron Smoorenburg as Freddy Pinto, an MMA fighter; Brahim Achabbakhe as Maxi Pinto, an MMA fighter; Bjorn Freiberg as Jogi Nanda, an MMA fighter; Elroy Jansen as Jansher Khan, an MMA fighter; Meiyang Chang as himself; Kubra Sait as herself; Riva Babbar as herself; and Salman Khan as himself.
