The book is divided into six parts, each focusing on a specific historical period and theme. The first part, "The Indigenous Tradition", examines the vernacular architecture of the various ethnic groups in the Philippines, such as the Ifugao, Maranao, Tausug, and Ivatan. The second part, "The Colonial Encounter", discusses the impact of Spanish and American colonization on Philippine architecture, especially in terms of religious buildings, civic structures, and domestic spaces. The third part, "The Emergence of Filipino Nationalism", analyzes the rise of a distinct Filipino architectural style in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influenced by neoclassicism, art nouveau, art deco, and tropical modernism. The fourth part, "The Postwar Reconstruction", explores the challenges and opportunities faced by Philippine architects after World War II, such as rebuilding the war-torn cities, addressing the housing crisis, and creating new urban centers. The fifth part, "The Martial Law Years", investigates the role of architecture in legitimizing and contesting the authoritarian regime of Ferdinand Marcos, as well as the emergence of alternative and critical practices. The sixth part, "The Contemporary Scene", surveys the current trends and issues in Philippine architecture, such as globalization, sustainability, heritage conservation, and social responsibility.
 
The book is a valuable contribution to the field of Philippine studies, as it provides a comprehensive and nuanced account of the history and development of Philippine architecture and urbanism. It also showcases the diversity and richness of Filipino culture and identity, as expressed through its built environment. The book is not only informative but also engaging, as it uses various sources such as photographs, drawings, maps, diagrams, archival materials, and personal narratives to illustrate its arguments. The book is also accessible to a wide range of readers, as it uses clear and simple language to explain complex concepts and terms. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in Philippine architecture, history, culture, or society.
  
The book is not only a historical account, but also a critical analysis of Philippine architecture and urbanism. Lico challenges the dominant narratives and myths that have shaped the perception and practice of Philippine architecture, such as the notion of a "pure" or "authentic" Filipino style, the influence of foreign models and trends, and the role of architecture in nation-building and development. He also examines the social, political, economic, and cultural factors that have influenced the production and consumption of Philippine architecture, such as colonialism, nationalism, globalization, neoliberalism, and postmodernism. He also highlights the agency and creativity of Filipino architects and their contributions to the global architectural discourse.
